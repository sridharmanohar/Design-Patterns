## Halting Problem
1. Given a arbitary computer program and input, the problem in determining whether this program is going to finish running (halt) or run forever with the given input is known as Halting Problem.
2. Term coined by Alan Turing.
3. This is the reason because of which we cannot have any big o notation code analysis tools because they cannot correctly determine in all cases if the programwith the given input will halt or run forever.
