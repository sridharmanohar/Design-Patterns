## Difference b/w Sorted and Ordered collections:
1. Ordered: means you can predict the traversal/access of the data in the data structure/collection like a fifo or lifo.
2. Sorted: a special case of ordering, where the ds in question follows a special ordeing algo. to sort like asc or desc or alphabetical.
3. Sorting dependes upon the type of the data in the ds.
4. If a collection is sorted then it means it is by default ordered.
5. Examples of ordered collections: ArrayList, LinkedList, LinkedHashSet, LinkedHashMap
6. Ex. of sorted collections: TreeSet, TreeMap.
7. Ex, of unordered colelctions: Set, Map
